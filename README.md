SENTIMENT ANLAYSIS ON MOVIE REVIEWS


ABSTRACT
In this project we planned to do Sentiment analysis on Movie reviews. 
Sentiment analysis is focused on the extraction of opinions of the people 
towards a particular topic from a textual data. In this project we try to focus on 
sentiment analysis on Rotten Tomatoes movie review database. We examine 
the sentiment expression to classify the polarity of the movie review on a scale 
of 0(highly disliked) to 4(highly liked) and perform feature extraction and 
ranking and use these features to train our multilabel classifier to classify the 
movie review into its correct label. We are going to implement some of the 
Machine Learning Algorithms in order to compare the final Accuracy results In 
addition, a comparative study on different classification approaches has been 
performed to determine the most suitable classifier to suit our problem domain.


MACHINE LEARNING MODELS:
